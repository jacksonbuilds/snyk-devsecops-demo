# snyk-devsecops-demo
This project demonstrates end-to-end integration of Snyk into a DevSecOps pipeline to detect and remediate vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies and Docker containers. Built with infrastructure-as-code principles and security automation tools including Ansible, Docker, and Python, the project simulates a real-world secure CI/CD workflow.
